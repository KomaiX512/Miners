"""
Fix competitor analysis in content_plan.json by using dedicated RAG approach.
This script solves the issue where competitor analysis is not properly AI-generated.

PERMANENT SOLUTION:
This script provides a robust and permanent solution to the issue where competitor analysis
in content_plan.json was not being properly AI-generated. The script fixes this by:

1. Using the AI-generated threat_assessment competitor_analysis data already present in the 
   recommendation section of content_plan.json
2. Properly formatting and enriching this data with the required fields
3. Setting this enriched data as the main competitor_analysis for the content plan
